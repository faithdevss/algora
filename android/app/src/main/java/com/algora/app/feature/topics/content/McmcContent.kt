        "Bayesian inference keeps running into the same wall. The posterior is p(θ|D) ∝ p(D|θ)p(θ), and turning that proportionality into an equality requires dividing by ∫p(D|θ)p(θ)dθ — an integral over the whole parameter space that is almost never solvable in closed form and hopeless numerically past a handful of dimensions.",
        "MCMC sidesteps it entirely. Rather than compute the posterior, build a Markov chain whose stationary distribution *is* the posterior, run it, and treat the states it visits as samples. Metropolis-Hastings does this with one idea: propose a move, and accept it with probability min(1, p(new)/p(old)). Because that ratio is all you need, the unknown normalizing constant cancels — you never had to compute the thing that was blocking you. Uphill moves are always accepted; downhill moves are accepted sometimes, which is what stops the chain collapsing onto the mode and lets it map the whole distribution.",
        "What makes it usable in practice is knowing its failure modes, which are quiet rather than loud. Early samples come from wherever you initialized, not from the posterior, so they must be discarded as burn-in. Consecutive samples are correlated, so a thousand iterations are worth far fewer independent draws — the effective sample size, not the iteration count, is the number that matters. And step size fails in both directions: too small and the chain accepts nearly everything while barely moving; too large and almost every proposal is rejected so it sticks in place. Both produce highly correlated samples from opposite causes, which is why roughly 25% acceptance is the rule of thumb for a random walk. Convergence is never provable — you can only fail to detect a problem, using R̂ across independently initialized chains and by looking at the traces.",
